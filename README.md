## Legacy source (important)

The file `legacy/valki-talki-single.html` contains the original
single-file Valki Talki widget as it is currently used in production.

This file is NOT used directly at runtime.
It exists as a reference source for refactors and automated PRs
(e.g. Codex / AI agents).

The goal is to convert this file into a self-injecting widget:
`widget/valki-talki.js`
